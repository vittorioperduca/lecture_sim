### Some instructions about R Markdown
* R Markdown is an authoring format developed by RStudio which allows to easily build reports with text sections and embedded R code chunks. Text sections are written using simple Markdown syntax, and therefore .Rmd files can be compiled in html, pdf or even word format. 
* R Markdown is an effective way to write reproducible research documents as output files are automatically regenerated whenever underlying R code or data changes. For instance, if one wants to change an R plot, it suffices to change the underlying R chunk.
* Useful documentation and tutorials can be found through the __Help__ menu or online \
http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html \
for useful documentation.
* If you have a TeX distribution on your machine, you can typeset mathematical formulas in text chunks using LaTeX syntax, see for instance \
